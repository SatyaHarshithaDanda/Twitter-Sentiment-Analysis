Implement a text classification model for sentiment analysis using a pre-trained word embedding model like Word2Vec or GloVe. Train and evaluate the model on a sentiment analysis dataset.
# 💬 Twitter Sentiment Analysis with LSTMs & Pretrained Embeddings

This project implements a deep learning-based **text classification model** for **sentiment analysis** on Twitter data. It utilizes **pretrained word embedding vectors** (such as GloVe or Word2Vec) and a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network to detect whether a tweet expresses a **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiment.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a key Natural Language Processing (NLP) task used to determine the emotional tone behind textual data. In this project:

- Tweets are preprocessed and tokenized
- Tokens are converted into dense vectors using **pretrained embeddings**
- An LSTM-based model is trained to classify sentiment
- Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 📁 Files Included

- `Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_in_Python_with_LSTMs_&_Pretrained_Embedding_Vectors.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – for building and training LSTM model
- **GloVe / Word2Vec** – for pretrained word embeddings
- **NLTK / re / string** – for tweet preprocessing
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** – for performance metrics

## 🗂️ Dataset

The model is trained and tested on a Twitter sentiment dataset. You can use datasets such as:

- [Sentiment140](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students)
- [Kaggle Tweet Sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140)

## 📈 Example Results

Accuracy: ~85% (depending on dataset and parameters)
Sample Prediction:
```vbnet
Tweet: "I love this new phone! 😍"
Predicted Sentiment: Positive
```

## 🔍 Key Features

- Custom tweet preprocessing pipeline
- Integration of pretrained embeddings for better generalization
- LSTM model for sequential context understanding
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification metrics

📚 Future Improvements
- Add attention mechanism to the LSTM
- Use BERT or other transformer-based embeddings
- Build a web interface or Twitter sentiment monitoring dashboard
